# ML-SM Early Detection of Cardiac Arrest in Newborn Babies

Hey there! Iâ€™m Hindhu, your final-year BTech friend! ðŸŽ“âœ¨ Welcome to GitHub, where we can play, learn, and collaborate on exciting projects together. With a passion for coding and a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development, I love diving into innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges.

### Overview

Cardiac arrest in newborns is a critical condition that requires early detection to improve outcomes. Machine learning models can analyze vital signs and medical histories to identify risk factors and predict potential cardiac arrest, enabling timely interventions. This approach enhances monitoring efficiency and can significantly reduce mortality rates in affected infants.

The model demonstrated promising results, achieving a delta-p value of 0.912 during training and 0.896 during testing, alongside favorable false discovery rates and critical success indices. Ultimately, the goal is to improve early detection and reduce mortality and morbidity in affected infants.

### Modules Overview

- **Service Provider Module**: Login, browse datasets, view accuracy results, predict cardiac arrest types, download datasets.
- **Admin Module**: View and authorize registered users with their details.
- **Remote User Module**: Users register and log in to predict cardiac arrest and view profiles.

### System Design and Development

- **Input Design**: Emphasizes accurate data entry with validation controls and user-friendly screens.
- **Output Design**: Facilitates communication between project leaders and clients; user authentication is managed by the admin.

### System Study

- **Feasibility Study**:
  - **Economic Feasibility**: Project stays within budget using mostly free technologies.
  - **Technical Feasibility**: Requires minimal technical resources for implementation.
  - **Social Feasibility**: User acceptance relies on effective training and support.
